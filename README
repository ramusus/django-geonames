This is an experimental application for using Geonames data within
GeoDjango.  To get started download the necessary data (read
`DOWNLOAD` in `data` subdirectory), add `geonames` to your 
`INSTALLED_APPS`, and run the following management commands.
These commands will take a while to run.

   $ ./manage.py compress_geonames
   $ ./manage.py load_geonames
